[meta="description"]
Design of a forward-compatible EVM that will not break contracts
when applying feature upgrades.

Forward-compatible EVM proposals are based on the observations that
currently most hard fork changes we want to adopt mainly results in
backward compatibilty issues in two categories:

* **Opcode Addition**: Appending a new opcode to the insturction list
  can break past contract's assumption of unused/invalid opcodes.
* **Gas Repricing**: Nearly all Ethereum contracts on-chain currently
  make at least some assumptions about gas costs. Gas repricing can
  break those assumptions.

## Disable Deployment of Unused Opcodes

NOTE: This section describes a specification, with identifier
https://specs.corepaper.org/40-unused[40-UNUSED].
(https://specs.corepaper.org/40-unused/discuss[Discuss])

If unused opcodes can break backward compatibility, we only need to
disallow deployment of unused opcodes to ensure forward
compatibility. As a result, the proposal introduce a new validation
process upon any contract deployment.

=== Specification

Upon contract deployment, either through CREATE and CREATE2 opcode, or
via contract creation transaction, run an extra validation step:

* Iterate over the code bytes one by one.
  * If the code byte is a `PUSH(n)` opcode, skip next n bytes.
  * If the code byte is a valid opcode or designated invalid
  instruction (`0xfe`), continue. 
  * Otherwise, throw out-of-gas.
  
=== Interactions

For any new additional opcode deployed, they should be added to the
valid opcode list, and subject to the check described in the
specification. Even if the new opcode is a multi-byte or
special-instruction opcode (for example `BEGINDATA`), this
specification ensures that it is forward-compatible with them. In
other words, new opcodes can modify the validation step as described
in specification, while have guarantees that no past instance of the
opcode has been deployed.

== Remove Gas Observables and Better Error Handling [[remove-gas-observables-and-better-error-handling]]

NOTE: This section describes a specification, with identifier
https://specs.corepaper.org/39-ungas[39-UNGAS].
(https://specs.corepaper.org/39-ungas/discuss[Discuss])

Core developers have long expressed their concerns that contracts
should not make any assumptions about gas cost. As a result, the EVM
itself should not make available any observables related to gas
cost. In particular, `GAS` opcode, and the gas parameters in
call/create opcodes. This specification also provides a better error
handling model, which significantly simplifies the threat model of
smart contract developers, discussed as part of
<<../error/execution.adoc#,Error Handling>>.

=== Specification

Apply the following changes to EVM. Firstly, disable `GAS`
opcode. Treat it the same as an unused opcode.

Secondly, change the current EVM error types into the following:

* **Recoverable Error**: An explicit `REVERT` opcode. This error will
  be reported back to parent execution frame. It refunds remaining
  gases, but revert all changes in current execution frame.
* **Unrecoverable Error**: Fatal error. Consume all gases, revert all
  changes in current transaction, and exit.

When an "out-of-gas" error happens in current execution frame, treat
it as *unrecoverable error*.  The behavior of `REVERT` opcode remains
unchanged, and it remains a *recoverable error*.

Thirdly, in `CALL`, `CALLCODE`, `DELEGATECALL` and `STATICCALL`, the
gas parameter is removed (opcode will pop one less item from
stack). Instead, the opcode will operate as if that parameter is set
to the current available gas stem:[\mu_g].

=== Interactions

When deployed together with account versioning, the fatal error
behavior should be preserved. If current execution frame has this
specification applied, then "out-of-gas" should always result in full
revert of current transaction, regardless of whether parent execution
frame is of legacy version or not. If child execution frame is of
legacy version, its out of gas error should remain the old behavior
and be passed to parent execution frame.

When deployed together with
https://specs.corepaper.org/40-unused/[40-UNUSED], `GAS` should be
subject to the unused opcode check prior to contract deployment.

=== Notes

* The current available gas stem:[\mu_g] passed to `CALL`, `CALLCODE`,
  `DELEGATECALL` and `STATICCALL` act as if it is *input* of the *gas*
  parameter. That is, the "all but 1/64" rule still applies.
